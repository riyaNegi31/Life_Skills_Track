## Learning - Process

### 1. How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique

#### Question 1
##### What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.
The Feynman Technique is a learning method that involves explaining a concept in simple terms to identify gaps in understanding and reinforce knowledge.

### 2. Learning How to Learn TED talk by Barbara Oakley

#### Question 2
##### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
One of the most interesting ideas from Barbara Oakley's talk is her explanation of the two modes of learning: focus mode and diffuse mode. She uses a pinball machine analogy to illustrate how these modes work together in the brain.

In focus mode, you concentrate tightly on a specific problem or concept, which is effective for familiar material. However, when faced with new ideas, you might get stuck due to the "rubber bumpers" in your mind. This is where diffuse mode comes in, allowing for a more relaxed and creative thinking process, helping you to explore new connections and solutions.

I also found her stories about famous figures like Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison using relaxation techniques to stimulate their creativity particularly compelling. They would hold objects (keys or ball bearings) and allow themselves to drift into a relaxed state, which would help them access new ideas when they returned to focus mode. This blend of structured focus and creative relaxation is a powerful approach to learning and problem-solving.

#### Question 3
##### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Active and diffused modes of thinking are two complementary cognitive approaches:

* Active Mode: This mode involves focused, analytical thinking, where you actively concentrate on a problem, apply techniques, and work through details systematically. It’s useful for problem-solving and tackling specific tasks.

* Diffused Mode: In contrast, the diffused mode is a more relaxed, free-flowing way of thinking that allows your mind to make broader connections and see the bigger picture. This mode often comes into play during moments of rest or when you’re not focusing directly on a problem. It’s helpful for creativity and generating new ideas.

Combining both modes can enhance learning and problem-solving effectiveness.

### 3. Learn Anything in 20 hours
#### Question 4
##### According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
According to the video, the steps to take when approaching a new topic are:

1. Deconstruct the skill: Break the skill down into smaller, manageable parts.
2. Learn enough to self-correct: Gather a few resources to understand the basics and practice.
3. Remove barriers to practice: Eliminate distractions that hinder your ability to practice.
4. Practice for at least 20 hours: Commit to practicing the skill for a minimum of 20 hours to overcome initial frustration.

### Learning Principles in the Bootcamp
#### Question 5
##### What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

Actions to improve your learning process:

1. Use the Feynman Technique to simplify and teach concepts.
2. Alternate between active and diffused thinking for balance.
3. Set specific deadlines for tasks and practice drills.
4. Eliminate distractions using tools like TimeLimit or Freedom.
5. Track time spent on tasks with apps like Boosted.
6. Focus on understanding and implementing concepts with curiosity and joy.
7. Regularly explain concepts in your own words to reinforce understanding.
8. Create a fun and personalized learning environment.
9. Prioritize mastering a few key skills deeply over superficial knowledge.
