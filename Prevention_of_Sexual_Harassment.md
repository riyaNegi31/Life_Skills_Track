## Prevention of Sexual Harassment

### 1. What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment? Sexual harassment includes any unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature that creates a hostile, intimidating, or offensive environment. Examples include:

- Verbal harassment: Inappropriate comments, jokes, or remarks about someone's appearance or gender.
- Physical harassment: Unwelcome physical contact like touching, patting, or invading personal space.
- Non-verbal harassment: Leering, making suggestive gestures, or displaying inappropriate materials.
- Digital harassment: Sending unsolicited messages, explicit photos, or offensive content online.

### 2. What would you do if you face or witness such behavior? If I face or witness sexual harassment, I would:

- Remain Calm: Stay composed and document the details of the incident (time, place, individuals involved).
- Confront (if safe): Politely but firmly let the offender know their behavior is unwelcome.
- Report the Incident: Immediately inform my supervisor, HR, or the designated Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in my organization.
Provide a detailed account with evidence if available.
- Support the Victim: If witnessing, I would support the individual by helping them report the incident and ensuring they feel safe.
- Follow Company Policy: Adhere to the organization's policies and procedures regarding harassment reporting and resolution.
