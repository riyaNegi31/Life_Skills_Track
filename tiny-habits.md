### Question 2
#### How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
To make new habits easier using B = MAP:

- **Motivation (M):** Make it fun or rewarding (e.g., listen to music while exercising).
- **Ability (A):** Keep it simple (e.g., start with 2 minutes of exercise).
- **Prompt (P):** Set reminders (e.g., place workout clothes in sight or set an alarm).

These steps help make the habit easier to start and stick with.

### Question 3
#### Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
- **Feel Good:** Celebrating creates positive emotions tied to the habit.
- **Brain Association:** It helps your brain link the habit with happiness.
- **Motivation:** Boosts confidence and makes you want to repeat the habit.
- **Builds Consistency:** Positive reinforcement turns small actions into lasting habits.

### Question 5
#### What is the book's perspective about Identity?
- The book says that identity is key to lasting habit change.
- Instead of just focusing on goals, it’s more effective to see yourself as the kind of person who practices the habit.
- For example, instead of saying, "I want to run," think, "I am a runner." When your habits match your identity, they become more natural and easier to stick with.
- Changing your identity motivates you from within, making habits part of who you are.
  
### Question 6
#### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
The book suggests making habits easier by following the Four Laws of Behavior Change:

- **Make it Obvious:** Place cues for the habit in plain sight.
- **Make it Attractive:** Find ways to make the habit enjoyable.
- **Make it Easy:** Start small and reduce the effort needed to begin.
- **Make it Satisfying:** Add a reward to feel good after completing it.
  
For example, if you want to exercise, lay out your workout clothes the night before (obvious), pair it with music you enjoy (attractive), start with just 2 minutes (easy), and celebrate finishing (satisfying).

### Question 7
#### Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
The book suggests making bad habits harder to do by applying the opposite of the Four Laws of Behavior Change:

- **Make it Invisible:** Remove cues or triggers for the habit from sight.
- **Make it Unattractive:** Change your mindset to see the habit as undesirable.
- **Make it Difficult:** Add steps or obstacles that make the habit harder to do.
- **Make it Unsatisfying:** Add consequences or remove rewards for doing the habit.
  
For example, if you want to stop eating junk food, hide the snacks (invisible), remind yourself of the health risks (unattractive), lock the pantry (difficult), and track unhealthy choices to see the negative impact (unsatisfying).

## 5. Reflection:

### Question 8:
#### Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
A habit I would like to do more of is reading books. To make this habit easier and more enjoyable, I would take the following steps:
- **Make the cue obvious:** Place the book where I can see it and set a reminder.
- **Make it attractive:** Pick exciting books and create a comfy reading space.
- **Make it easy:** Start with 10-15 minutes a day and keep a bookmark.
- **Make it satisfying:** Track progress and reward myself after finishing chapters or books.
  
These steps would help me make reading a regular habit!

### Question 9:
#### Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
I want to use my phone less. To do this:

- **Make the cue invisible:** Keep my phone in another room or out of reach.
- **Make it unattractive:** Turn off unnecessary notifications and delete distracting apps.
- **Make it hard:** Use screen time limits or lock apps during certain hours.
- **Make the response unsatisfying:** Track phone usage and reflect on wasted time each day.
  
These steps would help reduce phone use.
